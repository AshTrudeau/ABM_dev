# ABM_dev
Agent based model of recreational anglers

ABM scripts are in the "source" folder and can be run from "run.model.template.R"
This script also demonstrates visualization of the simulation outputs. For long runs,
it would be good to use a computing cluster; this thing is slow. 

"parameters.R" is also in the source folder, and it's where you specify things like
the number of lakes to simulate, recruitment parameters, etc. 

More information coming soon
